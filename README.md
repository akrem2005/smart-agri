# Smart Agri IoT Node.js MongoDB API

This is a Node.js MongoDB API for Smart Agri IoT, which provides a backend solution for managing and retrieving data related to smart agriculture. The API allows you to store and retrieve data from MongoDB, which serves as the database for the application.

## Features

- **User Management**: The API provides user authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing users to register, login, and manage their accounts.
- **Sensor Data Management**: The API enables the collection and storage of sensor data from various IoT devices used in smart agriculture, such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity. It provides endpoints to create, update, retrieve, and delete sensor data.
- **Device Management**: The API allows users to manage IoT devices used in smart agriculture. Users can register devices, associate them with specific farms or locations, and retrieve device information.
- **Farm Management**: The API provides endpoints to manage farms, including creating, updating, and retrieving farm details. Farms can be associated with multiple IoT devices and sensor data.
- **Data Analytics**: The API offers data analytics capabilities to perform various calculations and generate insights based on the collected sensor data. Users can retrieve aggregated data, generate reports, and visualize data trends.

## Prerequisites

Before running the API, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- MongoDB (version X.X.X)

## Getting Started
